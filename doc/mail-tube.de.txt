# Note that this template file needs to be UTF-8 encoded.  When looking
# for a template item, GnuPG scans the help files in the following order
# (assuming a standard Unix layout):
#
#    /etc/gnupg/TEMPLATE.LL_TT.txt
#    /etc/gnupg/TEMPLATE.LL.txt
#    /etc/gnupg/TEMPLATE.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/TEMPLATE.LL_TT.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/TEMPLATE.LL.txt
#    /usr/share/gnupg/TEMPLATE.txt
#
# Here TEMPLATE denotes the name of the template (e.g. "mail-tube"),
# LL_TT denotes the full name of the current locale with the territory
# (.e.g. "de_DE"), LL denotes just the locale name (e.g. "de").  The
# first matching item is returned.  To put a dot or a hash mark at the
# beginning of a text line, it needs to be prefixed with a dot and a
# space.  A single dot may be used to terminated an entry.  Depending
# on the template type certain variables (${NAME}) are expanded.
# Check the man page of the respective tool.
